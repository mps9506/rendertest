The goal of rendertest is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of rendertest from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rendertest")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mps9506/rendertest")
```
## Example

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars, results='asis'}
library(dplyr)
head(tibble::as_tibble(cars))
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

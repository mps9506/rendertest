Trying to figure out encoding problems when I use github actions to
render readme and pkgdown websites.

    ## Example

    What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


    ```r
    library(dplyr)
    #> 
    #> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    #> 
    #>     filter, lag
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    #> 
    #>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    head(tibble::as_tibble(cars))
    #> [90m# A tibble: 6 x 2[39m
    #>   speed  dist
    #>   [3m[90m<dbl>[39m[23m [3m[90m<dbl>[39m[23m
    #> [90m1[39m     4     2
    #> [90m2[39m     4    10
    #> [90m3[39m     7     4
    #> [90m4[39m     7    22
    #> [90m5[39m     8    16
    #> [90m6[39m     9    10

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, donâ€™t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub!
